![Totemic Overhaul](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tacodude7729/totemic-overhaul/main/.github/assets/title.png?token=AGU6FU3BX4ZOG663YHGGXVTAKX42K)

A mod that vastly expands upon the vanilla totem of undying behavior by adding customizable totems, netherite upgradability and loads of effects! Customize your totems to do what you need, when you need it or add some gunpowder to your totem and use it to crush your enemies. Use passive totems to gain extra health, jump boost, night vision, water breathing and much more.
